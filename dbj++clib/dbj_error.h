dbj++clib error mechanism

The API
-------

if there was no error dbj++clib functions can set the dbj_last_error
to the DBJ_NOT_ERR value.

dbj++clib functions will set dbj_last_error to the  error_descriptor runtime_index
of the error_descriptor created on some error
clients can use the error_descriptor created
by obtaining it using 2 methods:

// does not release the error_descriptor returned 
dbj_error_service.hold ( runtime_index ) 
or

// does return *released* error_descriptor
dbj_error_service.fetch( )

dbj_error_service has internal cache of error_descriptor's

users are responsible to release the descriptors they hold
by using :
dbj_error_service.release( ** error_descriptor ) ;

error_descriptor * dbj_error_service.status( )
this returns the speicial error_descriptor to indicate the 
number of taken slots and the max number of slots
in the cache

int dbj_error_service.reset( )
Completely resets dbj_error_service cache

If there are no more free slots in its internal cache
dbj_error_service reuses the slots starting again from 0.

dbj_error_service is integrated with C standard error handling 
as defined in errno.h
